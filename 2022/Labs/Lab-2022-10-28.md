Put this information in a python list of list
And write a code which iterates in this list of lists and print inside information.

2. We can use following code to produce random numbers between 1 and 20.

	import random
	random.randint(1,20)

Use randint and for loop to create a list of random numbers between 1 and 1000. 
Size of your list should be 100.


3. write a function that prints out a list using a for loop.
Use this function to print the list in the question 2


4. Using the list  in the question 2, find the maximum a5nd minimum numbers in this list.

5. Using the list  in the question 2, find the maximum and minimum numbers in this list using while loop.

6. Using the list  in the question 2, find the maximum and minimum numbers in this list using for loop.

7. See below code for producing an example list:

	size = 10
	l1 = list(range(size))

write a code which will produce a new list where every item in this list is square of an item in l1.
Your new_list should be something like below.

	l1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
	new_list = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
