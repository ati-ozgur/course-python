## python as a calculator


Python can be used a calculator. 
Python has all the necessary operators and rules as you know from school.


	print(4+5)

	print(4*5)

	print(5/2)

	print(5%2)

	print(5//2)


Only two operators % and // is a bit different.
% is remainder operator and // is integer division.
