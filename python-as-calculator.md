## python as a calculator


Python can be used a calculator. 
Python has all the necessary operators and rules as you know from school.


	print(4+5)

	print(4*5)

	print(5/2)

	print(5%2)

	print(5//2)


	print(2+1/3*3)

	out: 3.0

	print((2+(1/3))*3)

	out: 7.0


	print(2**5)

Only following operators are a bit different than normal mathematical ones.
- % is remainder operator 
- // is integer division.
- ** power operator. 2\*\*5 is equal to 2*2*2*2*2
