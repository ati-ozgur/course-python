##  Is Number odd or even function


Write two functions named is_odd and is_even, both has a single number argument. 
They should return the true or false according to argument.
When you write your functions, below asserts should work.
You need to fix following code snippet so that function definitions and assert both work

Assert:

	def is_odd
	    # write your function here

	def is_even
	    # write your function here

	assert is_odd(19)
	assert is_odd(20) == False

	assert is_even(19) == False
	assert is_even(20)
