## Palindrome Recursion

**Palindrome** from wikipedia.

    A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters 
    which reads the same backward as forward, 
    such as taco cat or madam or racecar or the number 10801. 


Please write a recursive function that finds if given input is a palindrome. 
For example: efe,  hannah, ava, anna are palindromes.
For recursion, you need to work following way:

    hannah
    anna
    nn

Test your function with above examples and test with at least 3 different non-Palindrome examples.
nixon, example, xxxzz
