# Create frequency table
extract following compressed file [animals.7z](animals.7z) in your computer.
Read the file using python file functions.
And create a following frequency table and print it out.

| Dog | Cat | Bird | Fish |
|-----|-----|------|------|
| AAA | BBB | CCC  | DDDD |


for AAA..DDD numbers of occurrence of animal should be.
Since we have 1000 rows in this csv file, total of these animals should be 1000.

	AAA+BBB+CCC+DDD=1000

Easiest way to solve this problem is to use data structure, we learned in this lesson. Hint: it is not list.
