# online interpreters

Normally, you have to install python in your computer but there are a lot of online interpreters.
Most usable one would be [https://www.python.org/shell](https://www.python.org/shell).


Below is an example run for the python.org shell 

![https://www.python.org/shell](./images/python.org-shell.png)

Open the [https://www.python.org/shell](https://www.python.org/shell). 
Then like above example, write 2 + 2, then press enter key.
You should see the result of 4 in the screen like above.
Then, write print("hello"), then  press enter key.
You should see the result of hello in the screen like above.

As an extra practice: write print("Hello World"), then  press enter key.
Congratulations, you have finished the mandatory starting practice of Hello World example for the programming any language.





With this shell, you can write simple code examples to try even using your mobile phone or tablet.
But in our course, we will use python which will be installed in our computers.
