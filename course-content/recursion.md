# recursion

A recursive function is a function that calls itself.

1. we have function that call itself
2. we have an exit condition
3. we should somehow change our input variables so that exit condition will eventually be TRUE.


## pseudo code 1

	if exit_condition_true:
		exit function
	else:
	  change input variable
		call itself again

## pseudo code 2

	if not exit_condition_true:
	  change input variable
		call itself again
	else:
		exit function
