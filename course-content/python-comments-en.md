# Python comments

Comments are ignored by python interpreter.
If we want to some of the writing to be not interpreted (executed) by python, we should use comments.
We use comments to give extra information to later coders.





```python
# this will not run
print("hello world!")
# this will also not run
```

Python has no formal multi-line comment but multi-line string is used for this purpose.


```python

# There is not multi line comments 
# but you can use multi line strings as such

'''
This is a multiline
comment.
'''


"""
This is an another multiline
comment.
"""

```
