# Variables


In every programming language variables used to stored data.
In python using = operator, you assign data to variables.
Variable names should start with letters or underscore (\_) and should not contain certain characters such as space " ", -.
Variable names can contain letters, numbers and underscores.
An example of variable creation.


	first_name = "Atilla"
	birth_year1 = 1977


Here, a string variable containing data "Atilla" with name of first_name and an int variable containing data 1977 with name of birth_year1 are created 
Python automatically discerns data type of the variable.
We do not need to give variable type.
You can find type of variable using type() function.


Try to follow [python naming conventions for naming variables](naming-conventions).
