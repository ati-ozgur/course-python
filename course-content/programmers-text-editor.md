# Programmers text editors

Source codes for programming languages are stored in plain text files.
Normally, we can use windows notepad or textedit for creating plain text files.
But programmer text editors are better choice since they provide features for programming like

- syntax hightlighting
- folder usage

and more.
There are a lot of choices for Programmers Text Editors.
You can use anyone of them but please do not use word or wordpad for editing your text files.

- Sublime Text (Cross Platform).
This is normally my editor of choice but we will use Visual Studio Coee mostly in the course.

- Notepad++ (Windows only): I also use this one.

- Visual Studio Code (Cross Platform) : Another popular choice.
Visual studio code (vscode) is an hybrid between programmers text editor and IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
It is not very powerful like an IDE but provides much more features compared to standart programmers text editor.
