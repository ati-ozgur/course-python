# command-line

Command line is where we execute our python programs.
You can see an example of command line in linux below:

We can open command line in windows two ways.

## opening command line using run menu

1. Using run menu, use Windows+R and write cmd


![run cmd](images/cmd-open1.png)

![cmd example window](images/cmd-example.png)

2. 
After we open command line (windows) / Terminal (MacOS), we go to directory of our source files and run following command.
Here **cd** means change directory.
We are starting in our home directory, from there going to Desktop and python-codes directory.
Write python hello.py to run example hello world program.
Do not forget to change hello.py to name of your program like "program_name.py"


	cd Desktop
	cd python-codes
	python hello.py
