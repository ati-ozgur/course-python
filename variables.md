## Variables


In every programming language variables used to stored data.
In python using = operator, you assign data to variables.
Variable names should start with characters and should not contain certain characters such as -.

An example of variable creation.


	first_name = "Atilla"


Here a string variable containing data "Atilla" with name of first_name created.
Python automatically discerns what type of variable.
We do not need to give variable type.
You can find type of variable using type() function.
