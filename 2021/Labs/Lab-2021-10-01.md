1. Ask user to enter a number between 1-10.
Output following star pyramid using that number
Below example, input number is 5, therefore 5 lines of stars are output.

		    *
		   ***
		  *****
		 *******
		*********

Do not forget to use string multiplication of python. 
Run below code and see the output:

	print("*" * 1)
	print("*" * 2)
	print("*" * 3)
	print("*" * 4)



2. This question is a [common interview question](http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest)

"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “three” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “five”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “fifteen”."

3. Find sum(1..n) > total

get an input from user a number named total.
Sum the numbers starting from 1 to n till they are greater than this total.
Print out the number 

	sum(1..n) = new_total > total

Example 1:  given total is 20, you stop at 6 since

	1 + 2 +3 + 4 +5 = 15 
	1 + 2 +3 + 4 +5 +6 = 21

You will print out 

	sum(1..6) = 21 > 20


Example 2: 
Think of this question this way. 
Find me sum(1..n) > 1000. 
What is n? 
Here n would be 45.

	sum(1..45) = 1035 > 1000
