Look at the [helper code](helper_print.py).
Using this helper code, you would rewrite stars questions.
You would do following things: 
a. write a loop version of the code that will print following shapes
b. write a list comprehensions version of a code that will print following shapes.

in your code number of star lines will be decided a variable named **n_star_line** so that we could create a variable number of star lines.
Look at the [helper code](helper_print.py) to understand how your lists should look like.
