### For 

For statement in python iterates over any sequence. 
This sequence can be a list, range or any iterable.
Below, we iterate over a name list

    >>> name_list = ["Atilla","Funda","Duru"]
    >>> for name in name_list:
    ...    print(name)
    ...
    Atilla
    Funda
    Duru
    >>>


for statement mostly used with range. 


    >>> for i in range(10):
    ...    print(i)
    ...
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
