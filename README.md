# Course Programming in Python


I would like to quote following end passage of excellent talk of [ACM Turing Lecture 1972 The Humble Programmer by Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html) 


>It has already taught us a few lessons, and the one I have chosen to stress in this talk is the following. 
> We shall do a much better programming job, provided that we approach the task with a full appreciation of its tremendous difficulty, provided that we stick to modest and elegant programming languages, provided that we respect the intrinsic limitations of the human mind and approach the task as Very Humble Programmers.


As it was in 1972, programming is still difficult but it is intensely rewarding.
Please try to learn programming.
Another quote from [same 1972 talk]((https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html), says better than I.


> This challenge, yiz. the confrontation with the programming task, is so unique that this novel experience can teach as a lot about ourselves.
> It should deepen our understanding of the processes of design and creation; it should give us better control over the task of organizing our thoughts. 
> If it did not do so, to my taste we should not deserve the computer at all!

## The Python Tutorial

[The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) is the example tutorial for python but it is prepared for programmers who are already proficient in another language; therefore, it is a succinct tutorial.
Nevertheless, most of its contents should be learned by our class by the end of the class.
Since our class is mostly consists of Supply Chain/Logistics students, we will skip some of the parts.
This does not mean that skipped parts are not important but rather I want you to learn more fundamental parts.
