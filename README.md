# Course Programming in Python


1. [Basic Data Types](basic-data-types.md)

2. [Conditionals Statements (if-elif-else)](conditionals-statements.md)





## The Python Tutorial
[The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) is the example tutorial for python but it is prepared for programmers who are already proficient in another language; therefore, it is a succinct tutorial.
Nevertheless, most of its contents should be learned by our class by the end of the class.
Since our class is mostly consists of Supply Chain/Logistics students, we will skip some of the parts.
This does not mean that this parts are not important but rather I want you to learn more fundamental parts.
