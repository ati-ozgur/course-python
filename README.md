## The Python Tutorial

[The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) is the example tutorial for python but it is prepared for programmers who are already proficient in another language; therefore, it is a succinct tutorial.
Nevertheless, most of its contents should be learned by our class by the end of the class.
Since our class is mostly consists of Supply Chain/Logistics students, we will skip some of the parts.
This does not mean that skipped parts are not important but rather I want you to learn more fundamental parts.
