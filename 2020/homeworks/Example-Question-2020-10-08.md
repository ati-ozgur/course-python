# Example Questions


1. Write a function that finds if a given string argument is [Palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).
A Palindrome string is equal to its reverse, that is its reading is the same backward as forward.

For example: efe, nixon, hannah, ava, anna are palindromes.

Test your function with above examples and test with at least 3 different non-Palindrome examples.

You may use [string functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp) in this function.

2. Write palindrome function again but use a loop that goes for every character in the input string.

3. Write palindrome function again but use recursion in its definition.
For example you need to work following way:

	hannah
	anna
	nn
