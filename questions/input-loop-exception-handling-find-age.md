## Input usage with loops and exception handling

Ask user for their name, birthday information.
You will then print this information in the screen.
You need to use built-in function input for this question.
Different then our similar basic question before you need to add error handling to this code when user enters something wrong.
If user ask something wrong, you need to ask for same information again.
Todo this, you need to add a loop and exception handling to your code.
Your code should handle following cases

- User can not give future date as birth year.
- User should enter meaningful date.
- If user enters a text for birthday like two thousand, you need to ask for an number
