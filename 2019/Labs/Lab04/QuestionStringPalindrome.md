## Question Number Palindrome

**Palindrome** from wikipedia.

    A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters 
    which reads the same backward as forward, such as taco cat or madam or racecar or the number 10801. 


Please write a code that finds if given input is a palindrome. 
For our purposes space and whitespace characters are distinct characters; therefore, "taco cat" is not a palindrome.

[Python string functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp) should be helpful.


Example output: 

    Please enter a input to test for palindrome: 123
    Input text 123 is not a Palindrome.

    Please enter a input to test for palindrome: 1221
    Input text 1221 is a Palindrome.

    Please enter a input to test for palindrome: madam
