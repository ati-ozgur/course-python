# Find Lucky Number

Your lucky number is a number between 1 and 9. 
You can find your lucky number via following procedure:

1. Ask for birth year: 1987
2. sum the numbers of birth year: 1 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 25
3. Since 25 is not a number, you again sum the number of 25: 2 + 5 = 7
4. Since 7 is a number, you found your lucky number.

Please write a code that ask for birth year and output the lucky number using the above procedure.
