# Find sum(1..n) > total

get an input from user a number named total.
Sum the numbers starting from 1 to n till they are greater than this total.
Print out the number 

	sum(1..n) = new_total > total

Example 1:  given total is 20, you stop at 6 since

	1 + 2 +3 + 4 +5 = 15 
	1 + 2 +3 + 4 +5 +6 = 21

You will print out 

	sum(1..6) = 21 > 20


Example 2: 
Think of this question this way. 
Find me sum(1..n) > 1000. 
What is n? 
Here n would be 45.

	sum(1..45) = 1035 > 1000
