# Introduction

This book is an introduction python programming.
The book content is not comprehensive for suitable content for beginners are added.
Programming in not an easy task but like every skill is learnable and with practice it improves.

I would like to quote following end passage of excellent talk of [ACM Turing Lecture 1972 The Humble Programmer by Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html) 


>It has already taught us a few lessons, and the one I have chosen to stress in this talk is the following. 
> We shall do a much better programming job, provided that we approach the task with a full appreciation of its tremendous difficulty, provided that we stick to modest and elegant programming languages, provided that we respect the intrinsic limitations of the human mind and approach the task as Very Humble Programmers.


As it was in 1972, programming is still difficult but it is intensely rewarding.
Please try to learn programming.
Another quote from [same 1972 talk](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html), says better than I.
